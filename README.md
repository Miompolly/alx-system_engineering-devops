DevOps is a software development approach that combines Development (Dev) and IT Operations (Ops) to enhance collaboration and efficiency. It focuses on automating and streamlining the software delivery process, from coding to deployment and maintenance. This integration helps teams deliver applications more rapidly, reliably, and with better quality.

Shell is a command-line interface used in operating systems to interact with the computer's core functions. It allows users to execute commands by typing text-based instructions. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular Unix shell and scripting language that provides powerful features for command-line operations and automation. It's widely used in DevOps for tasks like scripting deployment processes, managing server configurations, and automating repetitive tasks.
